SETUP                                           *flagship*

While not strictly required, the following options are highly recommended:
>
  set laststatus=2
  set showtabline=2
  set guioptions-=e
<
                                *g:tablabel* *g:tabprefix* *g:tabsuffix*
The default status line is a slightly tweaked version of Vim's default.  To
override it, :setglobal 'statusline' as usual.  Vim's default tab label is
difficult to reproduce (and in this humble plugin artist's opinion, not very
useful), so the default is instead based around the tab's current working
directories.  To override it, assign |g:tablabel|.  If you are not using the
GUI tabline, you can also assign |g:tabprefix| and |g:tabsuffix| to control
the content before and after the tabs themselves.  The defaults are shown
below:
>
  let g:tabprefix = '%{flagship#id()}'
  let g:tablabel =
        \ "%N%{flagship#tabmodified()} %{flagship#tabcwds('shorten',',')}"

If you adjust none of these configuration options, Flagship assumes you want
the preferred setup, and will automatically set the 3 options listed at the
top of this section.

EXTENSION                                       *flagship-Hoist()*

The function Hoist() is may be called from from a User Flags autocommand to
register a flag:
>
    autocmd User Flags call Hoist({scope}, ..., {flag})
<
The exact arguments to Hoist are covered in order below.

The first argument is the scope and must be one of the following:

There are four supported scopes:

Flag        Default display position ~
"buffer"    left of the status line split
"window"    right of the status line split
"tab"       end of the tab label
"global"    end of the tab prefix

Generally you will want to use "buffer" or "global".  The "window" scope is
for aspects of the window independent of the buffer itself, for example the
cursor position or whether diff mode is enabled.  Since these window
properties typically have a visual presence, use of a flag is often redundant
and unnecessary.

Next comes the position argument, which defaults to 0 (zero) and can almost
always be omitted.  If you have a flag that is particularly volatile, try
giving a positive number like 10 to sort it later.  If on the other hand it
very rarely changes, you might consider a negative number like -10 to sort it
earlier.

After that comes an optional dictionary of options.  The only currently
supported option is the experimental "hl", which names a highlight group to
use for the flag.  (Tip: re-add a plugin flag with a "hl" of "Ignore" in your
vimrc to disable it.)

Finally comes the flag itself, one of the following:

- A function reference
- A string naming a function
- A format string containing one or more % statusline expressions

For the first two, the function will be called from a %{} expression with zero
arguments, but this is not guaranteed: use |...| for future compatibility.
The result of the function will be wrapped in brackets if it isn't already.
Future versions may allow customizing the wrapping characters.

The % statusline format is not recommended for plugin use, but can be used for
a quick and dirty flag definition in one's vimrc.  For example, to show a
global indicator when 'ignorecase' is set:
>
  autocmd User Flags call Hoist("global", "%{&ic?'[ic]':''}")
<
If you are implementing your own statusline plugin, you may implement this
same interface to tap into the existing ecosystem of flags.  This is the basic
technique:
>
  try
    function! Hoist(...) abort
      " Your implementation
    endfunction
    doautocmd <nomodeline> User Flags
  finally
    delfunction Hoist
  endtry
<
Make sure your implementation of Hoist() ignores unrecognized arguments and
never throws an exception, for future compatibility.
